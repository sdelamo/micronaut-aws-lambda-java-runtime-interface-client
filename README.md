Spike to use [AWS Lambda Java Runtime Interface Client](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/tree/master/aws-lambda-java-runtime-interface-client)

instead of [Micronaut AWS custom runtime](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-aws/tree/master/function-aws-custom-runtime). 

I have added the GraalVM configuration in [AWS PR #235](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/pull/235) and [AWS PR #208](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-java-libs/pull/208).
